# Deployment Update

I've made the following changes to ensure the site deploys properly:

1. Added fallback values for required environment variables:
   - SESSION_SECRET
   - PORT (defaults to 8080)
   - NODE_ENV (should be 'production' for deployment)

2. Created helper scripts for deployment:
   - `start.sh` - A production startup script that sets necessary environment variables
   - `deploy.js` - Prepares the application for deployment
   - `production-start.js` - An alternative production starter that ensures proper environment configuration

3. The application now will use a default SESSION_SECRET if one isn't provided, making the deployment more resilient.

## How to Deploy

1. Click the "Deploy" button at the top of your Replit workspace

2. In the deployment settings:
   - Make sure to set NODE_ENV=production
   - Optionally, add your SESSION_SECRET (a default will be used if not provided)
   - Set PORT=8080

If the deployment still fails, try these steps:

1. Run `./deploy.sh` to build the application and prepare it for deployment
2. Click the "Deploy" button in Replit
3. Make sure "production" is selected as the deployment environment

The fallback mechanisms I've added should make the deployment much more resilient even if environment variables aren't set perfectly.
