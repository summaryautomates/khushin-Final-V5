# Deployment Fix Instructions

Your deployment is having issues because of environment variable configuration. To fix this:

1. Click the three dots in the top right corner of your Replit workspace
2. Select "Deployment" from the dropdown menu
3. Click on "Configure Deployment"
4. Add the following environment variables:
   - Key: `NODE_ENV` 
   - Value: `production`
   - Key: `SESSION_SECRET`
   - Value: (use the same value as in your development environment)
   - Key: `PORT`
   - Value: `8080`
5. Click "Save" and then "Deploy"

This will ensure your application starts correctly in production mode with the correct port configuration.

## Alternatively, you can use the existing files

1. Build the application first:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

2. Then deploy by clicking the "Deploy" button in Replit

The deployment should work correctly as it will now have all the necessary environment variables and port configurations.
