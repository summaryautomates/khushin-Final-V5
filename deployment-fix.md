# KHUSH Gift Gallery Deployment Fix

## Issue
The application was experiencing deployment issues where the site would show a blank page when deployed to khushgiftgallery.replit.app, while working correctly on the development URL.

## What was fixed

1. Enhanced static file path detection:
   - Added more potential paths to check for static files in production
   - Included Replit-specific paths like `/home/runner/app/dist/public`

2. Improved error handling:
   - Added better error handling when serving index.html
   - Added a fallback HTML page if the index.html cannot be found
   - Added detailed logging to help diagnose issues

3. Made environment variables more resilient:
   - SESSION_SECRET: Now has a fallback if not set
   - PORT: Defaults to 8080 for production
   - NODE_ENV: Properly handled with fallback values

## How to Deploy

1. Run the deployment script:
   ```
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

2. Click "Deploy" in the Replit interface

3. Make sure these environment variables are set in the deployment settings:
   - NODE_ENV=production
   - SESSION_SECRET=a2408a928353a9dc67e5d343bd022e4fbc900437a27869fc1d038cc17de00289
   - PORT=8080

## Testing the Deployment

After deployment, your site should be available at:
- khushgiftgallery.replit.app

If you still encounter issues, please check:
1. Replit logs for any error messages
2. That all environment variables are set correctly
3. That the build completed successfully

The changes made make the application much more resilient to the Replit deployment environment's specifics and should resolve the blank page issue.
