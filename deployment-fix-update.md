# KHUSH.IN Deployment Fix (Latest Update)

## Overview of the Fix

This update addresses a critical issue where the deployed application shows a blank screen. The error logs show a `Failed to load url /src/main.tsx` error, indicating that the application is trying to access source files directly instead of the built JavaScript.

## What Was Fixed

1. **Environment Variable Configuration**
   - Added explicit environment variable checks in the deployment process
   - Ensured that `NODE_ENV=production` is properly set and respected
   - Made sure the server properly recognizes production mode

2. **Deployment Process Updates**
   - Added deployment verification to confirm the files are correctly built 
   - Implemented additional path checks for static file serving

## How To Deploy Correctly

1. **Run the deployment script**:
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

2. **Add Environment Variables**:
   In your Replit Secrets or deployment settings, make sure these environment variables are set:
   - `NODE_ENV=production`
   - `SESSION_SECRET=a2408a928353a9dc67e5d343bd022e4fbc900437a27869fc1d038cc17de00289`
   - `PORT=8080`

3. **Click "Deploy" in Replit**:
   After completing steps 1 and 2, click the "Deploy" button in the Replit interface.

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter a blank screen after deployment:

1. **Check if environment variables are set correctly**:
   - Verify that `NODE_ENV` is set to `production` in the deployment settings
   - Make sure the PORT is set to 8080

2. **Check if the build is correct**:
   - Run `node deployment-checker.js` to verify the build output
   - Make sure `dist/public/index.html` exists and has the correct script references

3. **Redeploy with forced rebuilding**:
   - Run `npm run build` directly to rebuild the application
   - Then click "Deploy" in Replit interface
